	<p>The Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Romanum [ɪmˈpɛri.ũː roːˈmaːnũː]; Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων, translit.
		Basileía tôn Rhōmaíōn) was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity, it included large
		territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, and was ruled by
		emperors. From the accession of Caesar Augustus as the first Roman emperor to the military anarchy of the 3rd
		century, it was a Principate with Italia as the metropole of its provinces and the city of Rome as its sole
		capital. The Empire was later ruled by multiple emperors who shared control over the Western Roman Empire and
		the Eastern Roman Empire. The city of Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until AD 476 when the
		imperial insignia were sent to Constantinople following the capture of the Western capital of Ravenna by the
		Germanic barbarians.[dubious – discuss] The adoption of Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire in
		AD 380 and the fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings conventionally marks the end of classical
		antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Because of these events, along with the gradual Hellenization of
		the Eastern Roman Empire, historians distinguish the medieval Roman Empire that remained in the Eastern
		provinces as the Byzantine Empire. The predecessor state of the Roman Empire, the Roman Republic, became
		severely destabilized in civil wars and political conflicts. In the middle of the 1st century BC, Julius Caesar
		was appointed as dictator perpetuo ("dictator in perpetuity"), and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and
		proscriptions continued, eventually culminating in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the
		Battle of Actium in 31 BC. The following year, Octavian conquered the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, ending the
		Hellenistic period that had begun with the 4th century BC conquests of Alexander the Great. Octavian's power
		became unassailable and the Roman Senate granted him overarching power and the new title of Augustus, making him
		the first Roman emperor. The vast Roman territories were organized in senatorial and imperial provinces except
		Italy, which continued to serve as a metropole. The first two centuries of the Roman Empire saw a period of
		unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (lit. 'Roman Peace'). Rome reached its greatest
		territorial expanse during the reign of Trajan (AD 98–117); a period of increasing trouble and decline began
		with the reign of Commodus (177–192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its
		existence, as the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires broke away from the Roman state, and a series of short-lived
		emperors, often from the legions, led the Empire. It was reunified under Aurelian (r. 270–275). To stabilize it,
		Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286; Christians rose to
		positions of power in the 4th century following the Edict of Milan of 313. Shortly after, the Migration Period,
		involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman
		Empire. With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in AD 476 by
		Odoacer, the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed; the Eastern Roman emperor Zeno formally abolished it in AD
		480. The Eastern Roman Empire survived for another millennium, until Constantinople fell in 1453 to the Ottoman
		Turks under Mehmed II.[i] Due to the Roman Empire's vast extent and long endurance, the institutions and culture
		of Rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language, religion, art, architecture,
		literature, philosophy, law, and forms of government in the territory it governed. The Latin language of the
		Romans evolved into the Romance languages of the medieval and modern world, while Medieval Greek became the
		language of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Empire's adoption of Christianity led to the formation of medieval
		Christendom. Roman and Greek art had a profound impact on the Italian Renaissance. Rome's architectural
		tradition served as the basis for Romanesque, Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture, and also had a strong
		influence on Islamic architecture. The rediscovery of Greek and Roman science and technology (which also formed
		the basis for Islamic science) in Medieval Europe led to the Scientific Renaissance and Scientific Revolution.
		The corpus of Roman law has its descendants in many modern legal systems of the world, such as the Napoleonic
		Code of France, while Rome's republican institutions have left an enduring legacy, influencing the Italian
		city-state republics of the medieval period, as well as the early United States and other modern democratic
		republics.Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC,
		though it did not expand outside the Italian peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Then, it was an "empire" (i.e.,
		a great power) long before it had an emperor.[10] The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a
		network of towns left to rule themselves (though with varying degrees of independence from the Roman Senate) and
		provinces administered by military commanders. It was ruled, not by emperors, but by annually elected
		magistrates (Roman consuls above all) in conjunction with the Senate.[11] For various reasons, the 1st century
		BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors.[12][13][14] The
		consuls' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium, which literally means "command" (though
		typically in a military sense).[15] Occasionally, successful consuls were given the honorary title imperator
		(commander), and this is the origin of the word emperor (and empire) since this title (among others) was always
		bestowed to the early emperors upon their accession.[16] Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts,
		conspiracies, and civil wars from the late second century BC onward, while greatly extending its power beyond
		Italy. This was the period of the Crisis of the Roman Republic. Towards the end of this era, in 44 BC, Julius
		Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated. The faction of his assassins was driven from
		Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and Caesar's adopted son
		Octavian. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian's
		forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate and
		People of Rome made Octavian princeps ("first citizen") with proconsular imperium, thus beginning the Principate
		(the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the title Augustus
		("the venerated"). Though the old constitutional machinery remained in place, Augustus came to predominate it.
		Although the republic stood in name, contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had
		all meaningful authority in Rome.[17] Since his rule ended a century of civil wars and began an unprecedented
		period of peace and prosperity, he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de
		jure. During the years of his rule, a new constitutional order emerged (in part organically and in part by
		design), so that, upon his death, this new constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as
		the new emperor. In 117 AD, under the rule of Trajan, the Roman Empire, at its farthest extent, dominated much
		of the Mediterranean Basin, spanning three continents.The 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is
		traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ("Roman Peace"). During this period, the cohesion of the empire was
		furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced.
		Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent but put down "mercilessly and swiftly" when they occurred.[18] The
		success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of
		talented potential heirs. The Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius,
		and Nero—before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged
		as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, to be followed by the Nerva–Antonine
		dynasty which produced the "Five Good Emperors": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and the
		philosophically-inclined Marcus Aurelius. In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius, a contemporary
		observer, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 AD marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of
		rust and iron"[19]—a famous comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus'
		reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire.[20][21] In 212 AD, during the reign of Caracalla,
		Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. But despite this gesture of
		universality, the Severan dynasty was tumultuous—an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or
		execution—and, following its collapse, the Roman Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a
		period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and plague.[22] In defining historical epochs, this crisis
		is sometimes viewed as marking the transition from Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity. Aurelian (r. 270–275)
		brought the empire back from the brink and stabilized it. Diocletian completed the work of fully restoring the
		empire, but declined the role of princeps and became the first emperor to be addressed regularly as domine
		("master" or "lord").[23] Diocletian's reign also brought the empire's most concerted effort against the
		perceived threat of Christianity, the "Great Persecution". Diocletian divided the empire into four regions, each
		ruled by a separate emperor, the Tetrarchy.[24] Confident that he fixed the disorders that were plaguing Rome,
		he abdicated along with his co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed. Order was eventually restored by
		Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established
		Constantinople as the new capital of the Eastern Empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian
		dynasties, the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome.
		The reign of Julian, who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius attempted to restore Classical Roman and
		Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last
		emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the
		empire.[25] The Roman Empire by 476, noting western and eastern divisions The Western Roman Empire began to
		disintegrate in the early 5th century as Germanic migrations and invasions overwhelmed the capacity of the
		empire to assimilate the migrants and fight off the invaders. The Romans were successful in fighting off all
		invaders, most famously Attila,[26] although the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious
		loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself.[27] Most chronologies place the end of the Western
		Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer.[28][29][30]
		By placing himself under the rule of the Eastern Emperor, rather than naming a puppet emperor of his own,
		Odoacer ended the Western Empire. He did this by declaring Zeno sole emperor, and placing himself as his nominal
		subordinate. In reality, Italy was now ruled by Odoacer alone.[28][29][31] The Eastern Roman Empire, also called
		the Byzantine Empire by later historians, continued to exist until the reign of Constantine XI Palaiologos. The
		last Roman emperor died in battle on 29 May 1453 against Mehmed II "the Conqueror" and his Ottoman forces in the
		final stages of the siege of Constantinople. Mehmed II would himself also claim the title of caesar or Kayser-i
		Rum in an attempt to claim a connection to the Roman Empire.The Roman Empire was one of the largest in history,
		with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.[33] The Latin phrase imperium
		sine fine ("empire without end"[34]) expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In
		Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid, limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by their supreme deity
		Jupiter.[35] This claim of universal dominion was renewed and perpetuated when the Empire came under Christian
		rule in the 4th century.[j] In addition to annexing large regions in their quest for empire-building, the Romans
		were also very large sculptors of their environment who directly altered their geography. For instance, entire
		forests were cut down to provide enough wood resources for an expanding empire.[37] The cities of the Roman
		world in the Imperial Period.[38] In reality, Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic, though
		parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century AD, when Roman control in Europe, Africa, and Asia
		was strengthened. During the reign of Augustus, a "global map of the known world" was displayed for the first
		time in public at Rome, coinciding with the composition of the most comprehensive work on political geography
		that survives from antiquity, the Geography of the Pontic Greek writer Strabo.[39] When Augustus died, the
		commemorative account of his achievements (Res Gestae) prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of
		peoples and places within the Empire.[40] Geography, the census, and the meticulous keeping of written records
		were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration.[41] A segment of the ruins of Hadrian's Wall in northern
		England, overlooking Crag Lough The Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan (r. 98–117),[42]
		encompassing an area of 5 million square kilometres.[6][7] The traditional population estimate of 55–60 million
		inhabitants[43] accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world's total population[44] and made it
		the largest population of any unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century.[45] Recent
		demographic studies have argued for a population peak ranging from 70 million to more than 100 million.[46] Each
		of the three largest cities in the Empire – Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch – was almost twice the size of any
		European city at the beginning of the 17th century.[47] As the historian Christopher Kelly has described
		it:Trajan's successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines)
		were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled.[42] The most heavily fortified borders were the most
		unstable.[13] Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an ever-present
		barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.[48]The language of the Romans was Latin,
		which Virgil emphasized as a source of Roman unity and tradition.[49] Until the time of Alexander Severus (r.
		222–235), the birth certificates and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin.[50] Latin was the
		language of the law courts in the West and of the military throughout the Empire,[51] but was not imposed
		officially on peoples brought under Roman rule.[52] This policy contrasts with that of Alexander the Great, who
		aimed to impose Greek throughout his empire as the official language.[53] As a consequence of Alexander's
		conquests, Koine Greek had become the shared language around the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor.[54]
		The "linguistic frontier" dividing the Latin West and the Greek East passed through the Balkan peninsula.[55]
